I'm currently working on:
- [egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg): a new e-graph library for compiler optimizations and program synthesis
- [Titanic](https://github.com/billzorn/titanic): a framework for analyzing floating point accuracy and number systems
- [Szalinski](https://github.com/uwplse/szalinski/): a tool to decompile constructive solid geometry expressions to parameterized CAD programs
- [Reincarnate](https://github.com/uwplse/reincarnate-aec): a tool to decompile 3D triangle meshes to constructive solid geometry expressions
- [Herbie](https://github.com/uwplse/herbie): a tool to automatically improve floating point accuracy
- [FPBench](https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench): benchmarks, compilers, and standards for the floating-point research community
- [TVM Relay](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm): a functional compiler IR for machine learning compilers
