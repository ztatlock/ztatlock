### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working on some new and continuing research projects:
- [egg](https://github.com/egraphs-good/egg): a new e-graph library for compiler optimizations and program synthesis
- [Titanic](https://github.com/billzorn/titanic): a framework for analyzing floating point accuracy and number systems
- [Szalinski](https://github.com/uwplse/szalinski/): a tool to decompile constructive solid geometry expressions to parameterized CAD programs (PLDI 2020)
- [TVM Relay](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm): a functional compiler IR for machine learning compilers (MAPL 2018)
- [FPBench](https://github.com/FPBench/FPBench): benchmarks, compilers, and standards for the floating-point research community (NSV 2016)
- [Herbie](https://github.com/uwplse/herbie): a tool to automatically improve floating point accuracy (PLDI 2015)

Some of our past research projects:
- [Reincarnate](https://github.com/uwplse/reincarnate-aec): a tool to decompile 3D triangle meshes to constructive solid geometry expressions (ICFP 2018)
- [Verdi](https://github.com/uwplse/verdi) and [Verdi Raft](https://github.com/uwplse/verdi-raft): verifying implementations of distributed systems in Coq (PLDI 2015, CPP 2016)
